# Game Engine Tools - Starter Project

This workshop uses a prepared starter project so we can focus on learning Godot
tools and adding features.

## Files in this folder

- `platformer-starter-godot4.zip` (coming soon)
- `build-starter-project.md` (how to create the starter project)

The starter project includes:

- A 2D platformer scene
- A player that can move + jump
- Gems that disappear when the player touches them
- The player always looks like the "idle" animation (even when moving)
- No score (yet)

## Importing in the Web Editor

1. Open the web editor: <https://editor.godotengine.org/releases/latest/>
2. Import the project zip:
   - Choose the zip file `platformer-starter-godot4.zip`
   - Wait for it to load
3. Press Play

If you get stuck, refresh and try importing again.

## Importing in Desktop Godot

1. Open Godot 4.x
2. Click **Import**
3. Select the project zip (or unzip first if needed)
4. Press Play

## What you will add in the workshop

1. Change animation based on movement (idle/move/jump)

4. (If time) Winner message when all gems are collected
